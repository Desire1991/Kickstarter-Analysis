## Overview of Project
After Louise finds out that her play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in short amount of time. Now she wants to work on two things: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date and finally she wants also to visualize her campaign outcomes based their launch dates and their funding goals using the “Outcomes_vs_Goals.png” and “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”
### Purpose
The purpose of this Analysis is that Louise want to find out what will be the outcomes based on goals and launch date of her Project
## Analysis and Challenges
Based on outcomes from the fundraising goal it looks like Louise achieved the goal because she had a lot of number of successful campaigns the only challenge here was to manage the time based on launch date.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In May Louise had a lot of going on because she had a total of 386 campaigns and among them all 234 was successful done. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcomes Based on Goals, shows that the range of 45000 to 49999 she has no project at all but when you check on Range of 1000 to 4999 there are 397 successful campaigns.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge encountered in this project was to find out the way of using the time accordingly since Louise had a lot of number of successful campaigns based on launch date. And she had a short amount of time
## Results
Louise successfully used her time well and she was able to manage not to cancel any of her campaigns
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The two conclusions than I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that May was a busy month for her, another one is that starting from April to December there were no live campaign going on

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The Percentage canceled was zero in all goal ranges
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This Dataset can limit you to achieve all your plans since you are not the one funding your project.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create some pivot tables of Outcomes Based on Goals and Launch Date same thing as their Graphs.
